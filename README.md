# Flask-Grade-Calculator

This was my first ever python project. It started out as a desktop application and after learning more about flask, I decided to go fully online!

## Description

The purpose of this is to translate grades which were given in percentage format and translate them into weighted GPA (eg: 4.0). Surprisngly this is hard to do through normal means so I've written this up to simplify that. Through a series of if-statements I can translate the percentage to the weighted gpa properly.
